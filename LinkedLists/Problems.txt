0. LLOperations -> 14-07-2022
    We're considering zero indexing
    Assuming the head is never NULL
    Remember to free when u delete coz it's cpp
    For delete we'll send head as a call by address parameter to reflect the changes in head pointer
    insertFirst O(1), insertLast O(n), insertatk O(k), deleteatIndexO(k), delete when node is given O(k), delete when node is given O(1), display O(1).
1. Reverse LL -> 14-06-2022
    O(n)
2. Middle of LL -> 14-06-2022
    O(length/2)
3. Merge Two Sorted LL -> 15-06-2022
    O(max of lengths of both lists)
4. AddTwoNumbers LL -> 16-06-2022
    O(max(lengths of both lists))
    Two numbers are represented as LL, with their LSD as first element.
    Cases: length of both ll is same, length is different (take care of last carry), carry is still left after the length of both ll being traversed. Make carry 0 after adding.
Always check if head is NULL or not.
