1. Reverse LL -> 14-06-2022
2. Middle of LL -> 14-06-2022
3. Merge Two Sorted LL -> 15-06-2022
4. AddTwoNumbers LL -> 16-06-2022
    Two numbers are represented as LL, with their LSD as first element.
    Cases: length of both ll is same, length is different (take care of last carry), carry is still left after the length of both ll being traversed. Make carry 0 after adding.
Always check if head is NULL or not.
